## ðŸ“” Introduction

PhotographyApp is a reference application for HMS Kits to phones running with the android based HMS
Service. PhotographyApp basically is an app which has everything you could want from a photo app. It
can separate your photos by tags thanks to ML kit feature. It can cluster your photos based on

      . Actually this password and alias are not mandatory but if you want to sign with different
      alias or password please don't forget to change needed information in build.gradle (app:level)
      to with new information. Replace this file with ExploreLandmarks.jks which already exist on

    - Go to Cloud DB zone create a new DB Zone for the app. Then add these object types with same
      fields. Naming is important. Then change DB name in the CloudDBRepository with the same you've
      created in AppGallery Connect. If you encountered with an error please check models and object
